One weird cut is after the 2 hour mark, where it sounds like Bret is about to make a point, but I actually interrupt him for clarification and then go of on a tangent and never return. I edited out the interruption which made the cut look weird. I failed here both as an interviewer and editor. I'm trying to get better at both, and hire help for the latter, since I still do it all alone.

In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Eight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/lex\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nEPISODE LINKS:\nRichard's wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Karp\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:50 - Geometry\n9:46 - Visualizing an algorithm\n13:00 - A beautiful algorithm\n18:06 - Don Knuth and geeks\n22:06 - Early days of computers\n25:53 - Turing Test\n30:05 - Consciousness\n33:22 - Combinatorial algorithms\n37:42 - Edmonds-Karp algorithm\n40:22 - Algorithmic complexity\n50:25 - P=NP\n54:25 - NP-Complete problems\n1:10:29 - Proving P=NP\n1:12:57 - Stable marriage problem\n1:20:32 - Randomized algorithms\n1:33:23 - Can a hard problem be easy in practice?\n1:43:57 - Open problems in theoretical computer science\n1:46:21 - A strange idea in complexity theory\n1:50:49 - Machine learning\n1:56:26 - Bioinformatics\n2:00:37 - Memory of Richard's father\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman","tags":["richard karp","artificial intelligence","agi","ai","ai podcast","artificial intelligence podcast","lex fridman","lex podcast","lex mit","lex ai","lex jre","mit ai"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KllCrlfLuzs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KllCrlfLuzs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KllCrlfLuzs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KllCrlfLuzs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KllCrlfLuzs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"statistics":{"viewCount":"137390","likeCount":"2347","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"116"}},{"id":"LRYkH-fAVGE","retrievedAt":"2024-01-19T01:15:37.942Z","publishedAt":"2020-07-21T23:16:50Z","duration":"PT1H41M37S","originalTitle":"Jitendra Malik: Computer Vision | Lex Fridman Podcast #110","shortTitle":"Computer Vision","guest":"Jitendra Malik","episode":110,"description":"Jitendra Malik is a professor at Berkeley and one of the seminal figures in the field of computer vision, the kind before the deep learning revolution, and the kind after.

We discuss Lex’s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience, and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated. We consider how to find and follow your life’s purpose, maintain ongoing motivation and implement support systems to build and sustain momentum. Our conversation also covers capitalism, masculinity, chess and cheating, Lex’s idea for an AI robotics start-up and a Q&A from audience questions solicited on social media.

He jumped out at me because he seemed to be deep in thought and bothered by something profound, in stark contrast to other stuffed animals that usually have an aloof, empty smile on their face. I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff.

She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9.
